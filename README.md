### 🚀 Selected Work

## 🏔️ Featured Project: Hard Rock Treks & Expeditions
**Enterprise Trekking & Expedition Management System**

[Live Demo]([https://your-link.com](https://www.hardrocktrekking.com/))

### 🎯 Project Overview
A full-scale digital transformation for a trekking agency, moving from manual processes to a centralized automated platform. The system manages the entire lifecycle of a trek—from SEO-optimized discovery to secure booking and post-trip reviews.

### 🏗️ System Architecture
The platform is divided into three core modules designed for specific user personas:

* **Client Experience:** High-performance frontend focusing on Core Web Vitals, dynamic itinerary rendering, and a frictionless booking funnel.
* **Administrative Command Center:** A secure, private dashboard for staff to manage trek inventories, moderate user-generated content (reviews), and track lead conversions.
* **Automation Layer:** Integrated email triggers for instant booking confirmations and lead notifications via [e.g., Nodemailer / Resend].    

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** React 19, Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind CSS v4
* **State Management:** Zustand
* **Backend/API:** Next.js API and Server Actions
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Authentication:** JWT

### ⚡ Key Engineering Challenges
* **Dynamic Itinerary Builder:** Implemented a complex state-driven form for the admin panel to allow non-technical staff to create multi-day trekking schedules with nested data.
* **Search & Filter Logic:** Developed an efficient client-side filtering system for treks based on difficulty, duration, and price points without redundant API calls.
* **Reliable Lead Pipeline:** Architected a robust communication flow to ensure booking data is persisted in the database while simultaneously triggering transactional emails to both the user and the agency.
